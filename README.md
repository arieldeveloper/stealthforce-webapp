# stealthforce
Stealthforce is a social media web-application aimed for users to post about their hobbies, interests and projects in more detail than their regular social media pages. 

My goal for this project was to practice creating a full scale application in Django over the summer of 2020. There are still a couple little missing pieces that I am working on.
